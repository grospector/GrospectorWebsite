## 📋 UNDERSTANDING THE DATA TABLE

**Scroll down further to see "Bitcoin Distribution Overview":**

Each row shows:

- **Range**: e.g., "0.001 - 0.010 BTC"
- **Addresses**: Number of addresses in that range
- **Percentage**: % of total addresses
- **Supply %**: % of total Bitcoin supply

---

## 🔍 WHAT EACH RESULT MEANS

### **Percentile Explained:**

- **50th percentile** = You have more Bitcoin than 50% of addresses
- **90th percentile** = You have more Bitcoin than 90% of addresses
- **99th percentile** = You have more Bitcoin than 99% of addresses

### **Categories Explained:**

- **Dust**: < 0.001 BTC (very small amounts)
- **Small**: 0.001 - 0.1 BTC
- **Moderate**: 0.1 - 10 BTC
- **Large**: 10 - 100 BTC
- **Whale**: > 100 BTC 🐋

### **Why This Matters:**

- Bitcoin distribution is extremely unequal
- Most addresses have very little Bitcoin
- Even 1 BTC puts you in top 20% globally
- The tool shows real-world wealth inequality
